# README for MUMmer repository
This was a repository that I created to house scripts related to using the software program MUMmer to identify synteny between the genomes of _Zizania palustris_ and _Oryza sativa_. (Even though there is only one script here...)

This should be considered initial/exploratory work that I did based on nucleotide sequence (versus gene order that was later done by Tom and Marissa with the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute). Archived because it is no longer the most up to date script.

## MUMmer_commands
Code used to do MUMmer analysis based on nucleotide sequence.
Was never turned into shell script format.
